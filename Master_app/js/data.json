    "details":"Germany had to wait until the final round of matches to confirm their place in the finals but a mixed qualification campaign should not obscure the fact that the current world champions are bursting with talent and must be considered favourites to add the European title too. Schweinsteiger, Ozil, Gotze, Muller, Reus… the names just roll off the tongue. Even if they don’t quite elevate the sport to new artistic levels, Germany are accomplished attackers and masters of control, and in Toni Kroos they have the player who has succeeded Xavi as the best passer in the game. He was the only player to break four figures for passes attempted (1,058) and passes completed (1,007) during qualification."

    "details":"Spain’s dismal demise at the 2014 World Cup ended their record period of international dominance but there is no reason to believe they cannot reassert their supremacy by retaining the title they won at Euro 2012 by obliterating Italy in the final. The retirement of Xavi and Xabi Alonso has given players like Thiago the space to showcase their talent and Vicente del Bosque has a huge pool of talent to pick from. One problem is the lack of a convincing No. 9, with Diego Costa scoring only once in 10 caps since picking Spain over Brazil, but just look at their options in midfield: Busquets, Iniesta, Koke, Fabregas, Mata, Cazorla, Silva, Isco."

    "details":"Les Bleus would have been second in this list if it were not for the recent scandal which has enveloped the team, with star striker Karim Benzema being charged over an alleged blackmail plot against team-mate Mathieu Valbuena and learning on Thursday that he will not be considered for selection while the police case proceeds and could well miss the tournament. Still, coach Didier Deschamps has a vastly talented young squad at his disposal. Real Madrid defender Raphael Varane and Juventus midfielder Paul Pogba could well be the best players in the world in their respective positions in a few years while a supporting cast which includes Hugo Lloris, Kingsley Coman, Antoine Griezmann, Anthony Martial and Patrice Evra has a perfect blend of experience and potential."

    "rank": 4,
    "details":"Top of the FIFA rankings and possessing one of the most talented generations of players to emerge from any country over the past 20 years, Belgium have to be considered possible winners at the Euros. They have world class players in the shape of Eden Hazard and Thibaut Courtois and some other young talents who may yet ascend to that bracket too in Kevin de Bruyne and Romelu Lukaku. It’s hard to pick holes in their squad and only a lack of experience on the biggest stages – although reaching the 2014 World Cup quarter-finals will help in this regard – gives you reason to doubt them."

    "details":"Roy Hodgson’s men were the only team to enjoy a 100% record in qualifying but came unstuck as soon as they faced quality opposition in Spain in a friendly last month. A subsequent win over an emotional France should not be taken into account given the circumstances. England have plenty of individual talents, and with the likes of Dele Alli and Harry Kane an exciting young group is emerging, but there are persistent worries over the form of all-time top scorer Wayne Rooney and Hodgson is also far from settled on his best XI. After trialling numerous midfield configurations and combinations since the World Cup, for example, Hodgson tried a completely new one against France as Alli was partnered by Eric Dier. There are too many question marks over personnel at the moment."

    "rank": 6,
    "details":"The Azzurri were unbeaten in qualifying with seven wins and three draws from 10 matches and possess a superb defence – with Gianluigi Buffon, Giorgio Chiellini and Leonardo Bonucci, amongst others – and a hugely talented midfield which boasts players of the quality of Andrea Pirlo, if he makes the squad, and Marco Verratti. But the lack of a star striker is a big problem. Southampton’s Graziano Pelle was their top scorer in qualifying with just three goals. Still, Italy almost always turn up at major tournaments and the beaten finalists from 2012 should not be discounted."

    "details":"The bookies don’t fancy them but Poland were the top scorers in qualification with 33 goals and in Robert Lewandowski possess the continent’s most potent centre-forward. No one scored as many as the Bayern Munich star’s 13 during qualification and if he is on form, Poland will be able to beat anyone on their day. They only finished one point behind Germany in Group D and will be hoping to make a big impact at their third consecutive Euros."

    "details":"Cristiano Ronaldo’s talent casts an oppressive shadow over this team but he did his bit in qualifying with five goals as Portugal won seven of their eight matches. The service of Joao Moutinho will keep him busy and if Ronaldo excels then Portugal could have a good tournament. If he struggles with injury, as he did at the 2014 World Cup, or if his move to a centre-forward position with Real Madrid disrupts his form then Portugal will be worried."

    "name":"Wales",

    "details":"Wales rose to as high as eighth in the FIFA rankings in October, a reflection of the brilliant job manager Chris Coleman has done with a team who reached their first major finals since 1958 when finishing second to Belgium in their group. Wales are not blessed with the resources of neighbours England, but have real quality in key positions with Ashley Williams, Aaron Ramsey and Gareth Bale, who top scored in qualification with seven goals. They may be bereft of tournament experience and placed in the bottom group of seeds for the draw in December – but make no mistake, Wales are a force to be reckoned with."

    "details":"Croatia were in danger of missing out on a place at the finals before they sacked Niko Kovac as recently as September. Ante Cacic restored their pride though and Croatia have every right to feel optimistic about their chances. Ivan Perisic of Inter Milan scored six goals in qualifying but the real heartbeat of the Croatian team is the partnership of Barcelona’s Ivan Rakitic and Real Madrid’s Luka Modric in midfield. It is arguably Europe’s best midfield combination – although fans of Germany and Spain may disagree."

    "details":"Firmly beaten into second place in their qualification group by England after losing home and away to Roy Hodgson’s men, Switzerland are nevertheless a team with a lot of talent to unlock, drawing on a promising generation of players whose heritage can be tracked across the continent. Xherdan Shaqiri, of Stoke City, is the star with four goals in qualification."

    "details":"Sweden are only this high in the power rankings due to one man: Zlatan Ibrahimovic. He scored 11 goals in qualifying, including three goals over two legs in their play-off victory over Denmark, and is by some distance his country’s best player, and only truly world-class talent. His ability alone means teams will fear Sweden, and in truth there is little else to worry about. Making their sixth appearance at the Euros, Sweden had a record of five wins in 10 qualifiers and although Ibrahimovic could fire them into the knockouts, they are unlikely to go deep into the competition."
